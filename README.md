chrome.fm
=========

This is only a POC, so be aware that the code is rather hacky. You might have to restart the plugin every now and then...

Scrobbling will only work for last.fm staff members at the moment, sorry.

Add it to chrome
================

* Clone the repository to any folder 
* Chrome: Settings > Extensions
* Check the "developer mode" checkbox
* "Load unpacked extension..." > choose folder with this repo

Connecting the pluging to last.fm is a quite complicated at the moment, I'm hoping to improve that soonish.
* Go to the options-page of the plugin
* Click on the connect link
* Authorize the app at last.fm
* Go back to the options page
* Wait for the confirmation
* Go to Settings > Extensions and restart the plugin
